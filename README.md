# Goal - $i^{th}$ : The Meal Planner

Goal - $i^{th}$ is a Python-based tool that uses linear programming to create personalized, cost-effective meal plans while meeting specific nutritional requirements. It takes into account both macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) to ensure a balanced diet tailored to your age, gender, and health goals.

**Principles**

- Focus on consuming locally available, seasonal foods.
- Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods over supplements.
- Keep food costs affordable by choosing budget-friendly, nutritious options.
- Avoid processed foods and aim for meals made from scratch.
