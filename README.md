Knap[Snack] is a Python-based tool that uses mixed-integer linear programming to help you create personalized, cost-effective meal plans while meeting specific nutritional requirements. It takes into account macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and water to ensure a balanced diet tailored to your age, gender, and health goals.
